===============

I was bored and indecisive to choose a wallpaper.

Usage: `./wallpaper.py -h`

### Disclaimer

You can change the default path for the wallpaper query by changing
the `path` variable in main.

I use `feh` to apply the wallpaper, either download it with your package
manager or change it in the `os.system` call at the bottom of main
